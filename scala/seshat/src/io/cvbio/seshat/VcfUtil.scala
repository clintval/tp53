  /** Some characters have special meanings in VCF files.  When they appear in strings for use as an INFO/FORMAT key
   * or value they must be encoded. These functions will perform this encoding/decoding for all characters as outlined
   * in VCF 4.3 ยง1.2. This function is not to be used on a string representation of a list of INFO/FORMAT values.
   * URL encoding is similar, but conflates Space (" ") and Plus ("+").
   * Spaces are allowed in VCF v4.3, but this isn't yet supported by HTSJDK so they are also encoded.
   *
   * In the case of encoding a list of INFO/FORMAT values encoded as a string, you must first split the string on the
   * comma-delimiter, encode, and then re-join the string:
   *
   * {{{
   *     "1.0 2.0,3.0 4.0,5.0".split(',').map(VcfUtil.fieldEncode).mkString(",")
   * }}}
   *

   * }}}
